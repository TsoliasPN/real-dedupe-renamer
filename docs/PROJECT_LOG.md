# Project Log

## 2025-11-28
Date: 2025-11-28
User-facing changes:
- Initial Tkinter desktop UI to scan for duplicate files with hash/size/name/mtime criteria, days-back filtering, and a keep/delete workflow.

Confidence: [High]
Notes / Decisions:
- Chose Tkinter for a lightweight GUI and a single-script architecture.
- Duplicate detection centers on SHA-256 hashing plus optional size/name/mtime criteria.
