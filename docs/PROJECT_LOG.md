# Project Log

## 2025-11-28
Date: 2025-11-28
User-facing changes:
- Initial Tkinter desktop UI to scan for duplicate files with hash/size/name/mtime criteria, days-back filtering, and a keep/delete workflow.
Internal changes:
- Added core Python app, README, requirements (optional send2trash), .gitignore, and LICENSE.
- Implemented SHA-256 hashing with size bucketing for duplicate grouping.
Commits/areas touched:
- `8e51edc` chore: initial import (`delete_real_duplicates.py`, `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`)
- `d805fbe` Initial commit (`LICENSE`)
- `54ee353` Merge main into master (merge commit)
Confidence: [High]
Notes / Decisions:
- Chose Tkinter for a lightweight GUI and a single-script architecture.
- Duplicate detection centers on SHA-256 hashing plus optional size/name/mtime criteria.

## 2025-11-29
Date: 2025-11-29
User-facing changes:
- UI upgraded to a results table with grouping, sorting, filtering, and collapse/expand actions.
- Added copy report, CSV export, right-click copy of rows/groups, and a scan-progress spinner.

Internal changes:
- Build artifacts updated to ensure JSON module support for packaged app.
- Release zip added and later renamed to include version.
- Commit message "Implement feature X" corresponds to a release zip only; no source diff found.
Commits/areas touched:

## 2025-12-23 (Done - Hash size cap behavior)
